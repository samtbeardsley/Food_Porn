In the modern digital world images are everywhere and we use them to communicate. Sharing experiences and ideas with all; from friends and family to customers and followers. Within this communication, one of the things we photograph most is food. The hashtags #food, #foodporn, #instafood, #yummy and #foodie are 5 of the top 100 hashtags on Instagram and, combined, have been used over 1 billion times. In spite of all of this sharing and the rise of the food blog, we also see cookbooks continue to be a medium in which we explore food. Undeniably, food is a necessary part of our everyday lives, but something that also ties us culturally and emotionally. 

As such, we have a long history of photographing our food with the first example attributed to scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1832. In the 70s the term food porn was used as “unhealthy for human consumption”, but was later reframed to comment on the aesthetically appealing qualities of the food. On the topic of pornography Justice Potter Stewart said “I know it when I see it”, but whether you’re sharing your newest kitchen creation with your followers, or are a professional chef enticing bookstore browsers to pick up your newest cookbook (yes, we’re absolutely judging this book by its cover), we ask: What is it that makes our photos worthy of being #foodporn?
